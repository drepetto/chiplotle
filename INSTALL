Dependencies 
============


Chiplotle has the following dependencies:

- Python 2.7
- NumPy (for number crunching): http://numpy.scipy.org/
- PySerial (for serial communication): http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/
- hp2xx (for image export / hpgl preview): http://www.gnu.org/software/hp2xx/hp2xx.html


Installing the official release
===============================

If you have `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_ just::

   pip install chiplotle


If you don't have *pip*, follow these steps:
 
1. Download the latest Chiplotle release from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Chiplotle.

2. Untar the downloaded file (e.g. `tar xzvf Chiplotle-NNN.tar.gz`,
   where `NNN` is the version number of the latest release).

3. Change into the directory created in step 2 (e.g. `cd Chiplotle-NNN`).

4. If you're using Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of Unix, enter
   the command:: 
      
      sudo python setup.py install

   at the shell prompt.
   If you're using Windows, start up a command shell with administrator
   privileges and run the command ``setup.py install``.


These commands will install Chiplotle in your Python installation's `site-packages` directory. Note that this requires a working internet connection. 


Installing the development version
==================================

If you'd like to be at the cutting edge of the Chiplotle development use the following alternative:

1. Install git if you don't have it already installed 
   (enter ``git --help`` to verify this).

2. Check out Chiplotle's `trunk` development like so::

        git clone https://github.com/drepetto/chiplotle.git

3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:: 
   
        virtualenv _venv -p python2
        source _venv/bin/activate

4. Install Chiplotle in development mode::

        pip install -e .

5. For development and testing::

        pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

6. To run tests::
 
        tox -r

hp2xx
=====

Mac OS X 10.13 note: To compile (without X11 preview), simply comment out::

        # Generic UNIX + X11 previewer (default) 
        
and un-comment::

        # Generic UNIX, no previewer 
        
in the ``generic.mak`` Makefile. Then use this Makefile to compile `hp2xx` following the `hp2xx` installation instructions.
