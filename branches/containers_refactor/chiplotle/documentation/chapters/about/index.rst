What is Chiplotle?
==================

*Chiplotle* is a Python library that implements and extends the HPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) plotter control language. It supports all the standard HPGL commands as well as more complex "compound HPGL" commands. Chiplotle also provides direct control of your HPGL-aware hardware via a standard usb<->serial port interface.

*Chiplotle* is written and maintained by `Víctor Adán <http://www.victoradan.net>`_ and `Douglas Repetto <http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas>`_.
