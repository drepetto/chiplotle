The examples in this directory are mostly for non-intuitive or special purpose code,
rather than general usage examples. 

Most Chiplotle classes and methods have examples built into their source code. 
To see the examples, just open the source file and look at the DEMO CODE section
near the end. For example, /chiplotle/geometry/shapes/ellipses.py contains:

## RUN DEMO CODE

if __name__ == '__main__':

   from chiplotle import *
   from chiplotle.geometry import *

   import math

   two_pi = math.pi * 2.0

   g = []

   for a in range(0,7):
      e = ellipse(5000, 1000, 500)
      assert isinstance(e, Path)
      rotate(e, (two_pi / 7) * a)
      g.append(e)
   
   io.view(Group(g))

+++++++

To run this demo code, you do something like:

> cd chiplotle
> python ./geometry/shapes/ellipse.py
