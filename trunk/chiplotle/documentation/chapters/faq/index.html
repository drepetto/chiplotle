Q: When I send a text file with HPGL commands to my serial port in the following way:
# stty /dev/ttyUSB0 9600
# cat bird.hpgl > /dev/ttyUSB0

my plotter starts drawing fine but will eventually just start pausing and drawing random straight lines. What's goind on? Do I have to be concerned with overflowing the plotter's internal RAM?

A: Yes. The plotters buffer will fill quickly, so you need to do one of two things.
1. set some hardware hand-shacking. (which Chiplotle does not know how to do
yet)
2. query the plotter every now and then to ask it how its buffer is doing. if
it's getting full, stop sending. resend once its empty again. This is what
Chiplotle currently does.

since you are sending bird.hpgl directly to your serial port, you are
overflowing.



yes. if you run the executable 'chiplotle', Chiplotle will automatically scan
your /dev directory and let you choose which port to use (in your case
ttyUSB0). then it will ask you what plotter to use. select one. then you
will have a plotter named p (probably better to name it plotter) at the
Python command prompt. then you can send both HPGLCommand Chiplotle classes
and HPGL string commands to the plotter using the write( ) method. e.g.

>>> # send an hpgl command as a string.
>>> p.write('PA0,0;')

>>> # send a Chiplotle hpgl command.
>>> pa = PA((0,0))
>>> p.write(pa)

the plotter 'p' will manage buffering for you.
if you don't want to work 'on line' and want to run your Python scripts,

instead of running the executable 'chiplotle' you can instantiate your own
plotter in your scripts with the correct serial port. e.g.

>>> from chiplotle import *
>>> from serial import *
>>> s = Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0')
>>> p = Plotter(s)

then send hpgl messages:

>>> p.write('PA0,0';)

or open an hpgl text file and send it:

>>> f = open('bird.hpgl', 'r')
>>> fs= f.read( )
>>> p.write(fs)


Q: Is there a facility in Chiplotle to send over already existing HPGL command files? (They are just ascii with hpgl commands in them.)
