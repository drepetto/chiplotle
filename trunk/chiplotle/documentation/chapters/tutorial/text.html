<h2>Creating simple Chiplotle HP-GL commands</h2>
<p>
Each HP-GL command in Chiplotle is implemented as a Class. Chiplotle HP-GL commands can be instantiated as you would normally instantiate any other class. Some commands require arguments, others don't:
</p>
<pre>
   chiplotle> PD( )
   PD(xy=[])
</pre>
<pre>
   chiplotle> CI(10)
   CI(chordangle=None, radius=10.0)
</pre>
<p>
All Chiplotle HP-GL commands have a <code>format</code> attribute. This attribute returns a string representation of the HP-GL command as sent to the plotter.
</p>
<pre>
   chiplotle> t = PD( )
   chiplotle> t.format
   'PD;'
</pre>
