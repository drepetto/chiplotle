<h2>chiplotle modes</h2>

There are three main ways of using chiplotle:

<ul>
<li>command line: an interactive mode where you type in commands one at a time and the 
plotter executes them immediately</li>
<li>Python script: you create an Python script that generates the desired chiplotle commands and
sends them to the plotter</li>
<li>HP-GL pipeline: you send pre-existing HP-GL commands from a file to the plotter using chiplotle 
as a simple serial interface</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running chiplotle from the command line</h2>
An easy way to get a feel for chiplotle is to directly enter some commands via the command line.
<p>
Change into the chiplotle directory, and start chiplotle by typing:
<p>
<pre>
./chiplotle
</pre>
<p>
You'll see a listing of the serial ports available on your machine. Choose the one that you
have your plotter plugged into.
<p>
chiplotle will attempt to communicate with your plotter on the selected serial port and the plotter
ID of the plotter it finds will be printed out. You will then be asked to select a plotter type.
Select the one that most closely matches the plotter ID. If there is no match, you can use the
generic Plotter, although you should be aware that some HP-GL commands may not work with your plotter.
<p>
After you've selected a plotter type chiplotle will print out some basic information about your 
plotter, including its drawing area. Now it's time to plot!
<p>
Let's pick up a pen. In HP-GL, the command to pick up a pen is "SP", which stands for "select pen".
To learn what parameters you need to pass to a command, look it up in the "HP-GL Classes" section
of the chiplotle documentation. Many commands take one or more parameters; if a command takes
parameters you put them inside a set of () after the command name. SP takes a pen number, and we 
want to select pen number one, so our command is "SP(1)". To pass the command to the plotter, you 
use plotter.write(). So:
<p>
<pre>
chiplotle> plotter.write(SP(1))
</pre>
<p>
Your plotter should pick up pen one. Some common commands, like SP, have shortcuts in chiplotle. So
you can also do:
<p>
<pre>
chiplotle> plotter.selectPen(1)
</pre>
<p>
to select pen number one. 
<p>
Now let's move the pen. To move the pen while it is in the up position, you use PU([x,y]), and to move
the pen while it's down you use PD([x,y]). x and y are the coordinates you want to move the pen to.
If you want to do a PU or PD without moving, just pass a blank set of coordinates.
So to draw a square you might do something like:
<pre>
chiplotle> plotter.selectPen(1)
chiplotle> plotter.write(PU([100,100]))
chiplotle> plotter.write(PD([200,100]))
chiplotle> plotter.write(PD([200,200]))
chiplotle> plotter.write(PD([100,200]))
chiplotle> plotter.write(PD([100,100]))
chiplotle> plotter.write(PU([]))
</pre>
There are shortcuts for PU and PD: 
<pre>
chiplotle> plotter.penUp([100,100])
chiplotle> plotter.penDown([100,100])

</pre>
To replace the pen and have a look at your magnificent square, you select pen zero:
<pre>
chiplotle> plotter.selectPen(0)
</pre>
That's it! Have a look at the HP-GL Classes documentation for a complete list of implemented
HP-GL commands.

<h2>Running chiplotle from a Python script</h2>

Simple drawings can be done by hand from the command line, but you'll quickly find that it's much
easier to put your commands into a Python script so that you can edit them, rerun them, etc. 
And of course since you're writing in Python, you can use all the features of the language in 
addition to the chiplotle commands. 
<p>
It's very easy to create a Python script with chiplotle commands. The first thing you usually need 
to do is import all of the HP-GL commands from chiplotle. So open a new text file and type:
<pre>
from chiplotle import *
</pre>
Next you want your script to run the chiplotle setup routine and import the plotter definition:
<pre>
from chiplotle.utils.run_chiplotle_UNIX import plotter
</pre>
This lets you select the appropriate serial port and plotter ID, and imports the plotter object
so that you can use plotter.write commands as in the command line examples above. Now you can simply
enter a series of chiplote commands:
<pre>
plotter.selectPen(1)
plotter.write(PU([100,100]))
plotter.write(PD([200,100]))
plotter.write(PD([200,200]))
plotter.write(PD([100,200]))
plotter.write(PD([100,100]))
plotter.selectPen(0)
</pre>

and save your script as a .py file (see examples/square.py for an example). To use your new program
just run it as you would any Python script:
<pre>
python square.py
</pre>
Of course this is just a very simple example. See the .py files in the examples folder for some
more elaborate scripts. 

<h2>HP-GL pipeline</h2>
If you already have a file containing HP-GL commands (from a CNC design package, old
design data, etc), you can use chiplotle to send those commands to your plotter. Your HP-GL
file will be a text file with commands like:
<pre>
SP1;
PU100,100;
PD200,100;
PD200,200;
PD100,100;
PD100,100;
SP0;
</pre>

To plot the file with chiplotle, first you open the file, then you read its contents, close the file, 
and send the contents to the plotter via the plotter.write command:
<pre>
chiplotle> f = open('square.hpgl', 'r')
chiplotle> my_file = f.read( )
chiplotle> f.close( )
chiplotle> plotter.write(my_file)  
</pre>

chiplotle will take care of all buffering and timing issues, so even large HP-GL files should plot
reliably. See examples/square.hpgl for a sample HP-GL file.

<h2>Creating simple Chiplotle HP-GL commands NOT SURE WHERE THESE GO!!!</h2>
<p>
Each HP-GL command in Chiplotle is implemented as a Class. Chiplotle HP-GL commands can be 
instantiated as you would normally instantiate any other class. Some commands require arguments, 
others dont:

</p>
<pre>
   chiplotle> PD( )
   PD(xy=[])
</pre>
<pre>
   chiplotle> CI(10)
   CI(chordangle=None, radius=10.0)
</pre>
<p>
All Chiplotle HP-GL commands have a <code>format</code> attribute. This attribute returns a string 
representation of the HP-GL command as sent to the plotter.
</p>
<pre>
   chiplotle> t = PD( )
   chiplotle> t.format
   'PD;'
</pre>
